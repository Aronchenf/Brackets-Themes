Easy and accessible way of loading code mirror themes into brackets.


How to

- Custom themes are 100% codemirror standard, please be sure to follow codemirror's theme guidelines.


Custom themes 101 guide
===============

- Custom themes are actually codemirror's themes, so you will need to be familiar with codemirror's theme guidelines.  You can read about in their manual for details, which I will outline below.  Open <a hreh="http://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html">codemirror's manual</a> and search for "theme".
<br>
- Codemirror's themes are based on css files.  Important requirements are that the file name has to match your css class definition in your css theme file.  E.g. If your theme file is called "default", then your primary css class name needs to have "default" in it.  Codemirror's guidelines require that the actual css class name start with ".cm-s-", so your fully qualified css class name will be ".cm-s-default".
<br><br>
To get you started, you could use the already existing custom theme "default.css".  Let's do the following.
<br>
1. Open the custom theme directory.  Navigate to your themes manager directory (extensions directory/themes) and you will find custom themes in the "theme" directory.  Brackets provides a quick way of accessing your extensions directory... Help > Show Extensions Folder.
2. Copy and paste the file "default.css" and rename it to "my-theme.css".
3. Open "my-theme.css" and replace "default" with "my-theme", which should end up looking like ".cm-s-my-theme".  You will also have a second class ".CodeMirror", just leave it there and the net result will look like ".cm-s-my-theme.CodeMirror".
4. In "my-theme.css", change "background-color: #F8F8F8;" to "backgound-color: red;".
5. Relaunch brackets, open a JavaScript file and you should see the document with a red background.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, codemirror does not provide documentation for all the different css classes you can change to customize your theme so I would suggest you take a look at the themes that codemirror ships with in order to get more details about what you are able to customize.
