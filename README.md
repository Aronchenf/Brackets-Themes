Brackets-Themes
===============

Easy and accessible way of loading code mirror themes into brackets.


How to
===============

* Install, please download the zip file and place it under the user directory.  Brackets makes this really simple by going to Help > Show Extensions Folder.  Drop in the uncompressed zip file, restart brackets and you should see Editor Theme in the main menu.


To do
===============

* Currently I save the current theme in the preferences via the PreferencesManager, which unfortunately seem to get lost when reloading brackets.  I would like to make the current theme a bit more permanent so that users don't have to set it every time brackets is started.
* I would like to have the themes menu under something like settings, but brackets currently does not seem to support submenus where I can drop in all the themes.
